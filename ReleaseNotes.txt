Connection Framework version 3 Release Notes

There have been quite a few changes to the API so take note when moving to this version. This is mainly in the arguments passed back in the upload/download of the delegate methods.

What's New

1. FTP can now connect to hosts that have multiple DNS names.
2. FTP has been fully tested.
3. SFTP support has been added.
4. WebDav and .Mac support has been added.
5. File Connection.
6. New class heirachy. AbstractQueueConnection and StreamBasedConnection makes writing a new connection class very easy. If subclassing from StreamBasedConnection all background threading issues are handled for you and all you have to do is create a state machine for the sending and receiving of commands. If your connection is not state based, then it is suggested not to subclass AbstractConnection, but rather implement the protocol.
7. Sample application has had more of the delegate methods implemented and better upload/download support.
